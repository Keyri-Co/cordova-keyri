## **Interacting with the Plugin**


### Initialize Keyri
To initialize the object, simply call the initialize method, and pass in your app key and api key, generated in the Keyri dashboard
```JS
let Keyri;
Keyri.initialize(appKey, publicApiKey, true, (message) => {
    console.log('CordovaKeyri.initialize', message);
}, (e) => {
    console.log('CordovaKeyri.initialize', e);
})
```

### Generate and retrieve association key
The association key is the cryptographic identity we use to identify users. It sits in the Trusted Development Environment, a hardware separated chip shielded from attacks to the main perating system. The key functions as a P256 Curve signing key. To generate:
```JS
Keyri.generateAssociationKey('kuliahin.andrew@gmail.com', (key) => {
    console.log('CordovaKeyri.generateAssociationKey', key);
    alert('Key generated: ' + key)
}, (e) => {
    console.log('CordovaKeyri.generateAssociationKey', e);
})
```

To look up an existing user's key:
```JS
  Keyri.getAssociationKey('kuliahin.andrew@gmail.com', (key) => {
      console.log('CordovaKeyri.getAssociationKey', key);
      alert('Association key: ' + key);
  }, (e) => {
      console.log('CordovaKeyri.getAssociationKey', e);
  })
```

### Enable QR Auth
QR Auth can be enabled with a single function call. This process handles scanning the code, generating the session info, displaying a confirmation screen to the user, and, should the user confirm, sending the encrypted payload the developer provides to the Keyri widget in your browser.
```JS
  Keyri.easyKeyriAuth(appKey, publicAppKey, 'Payload', 'kulagin.andrew38@gmail.com', () => {
      console.log('CordovaKeyri.easyKeyriAuth', 'ok');
      alert('Authorized');
  }, (e) => {
      console.log('CordovaKeyri.easyKeyriAuth', e);
  })
```

### User Signatures
The association keys can be used to sign data to send to a remote server. If the server has the user's public key (see above), it can then verify the identity of the user as a security measure. Below is an example of how to create a signature of some data, passed in as a string
```JS
  Keyri.getUserSignature('kuliahin.andrew@gmail.com', 'Custom data', (signature) => {
      console.log('CordovaKeyri.getUserSignature', signature);
      alert('Signature generated: ' + signature);
  }, (e) => {
      console.log('CordovaKeyri.getUserSignature', e);
  })
```
